      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Jason, and I'm a web developer based in Portland,
        Oregon. I have over 2 years of experience in web development, and I'm
        passionate about creating beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly
        websites that provide an enjoyable experience for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in frontend development, and have experience working with a
        range of web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exercising, playing volleyball, or
        at Super Smash Bros Melee tournaments, or exploring the incredible
        Pacific Northwest.
      </p>
